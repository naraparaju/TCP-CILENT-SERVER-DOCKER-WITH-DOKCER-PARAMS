Created server and client docker images
Executed both client and server on windows
Able to communicate between client and Server
Only single client and server connection
server will start first (docker run -it -p5555:5555 --network=tcp_net1 tcp-server:1)
client starts next (docker run -it tcp-client:1 172.17.0.2)

provide server container address by inspecting the tcp_net1 from docker inspect command to the clinet docker run command
